Step 1: Set one machine as the server
On Machine A (the one you want to listen for connections):

iperf3 -s

-s = server mode
It will start listening on TCP port 5201 by default.

Step 2: Set the other machine as the client
On Machine B (the one you want to run the speed test from):

iperf3 -c <server-ip-address>

Replace <server-ip-address> with the IP address of Machine A.
Example:
iperf3 -c 192.168.1.10

-c = client mode
This will connect to the server and perform a default 10-second speed test.

Example Output:
[ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bandwidth
[  5]   0.00-10.00  sec   112 MBytes   94.0 Mbits/sec

Transfer = Total data moved
Bandwidth = Speed of connection

A few useful options:
-t 30 → Run the test for 30 seconds instead of 10.
-u → Use UDP instead of TCP (good for testing streaming performance).
-p 5000 → Use a different port (if you want something other than 5201).

Example for UDP test:

iperf3 -c 192.168.1.10 -u
